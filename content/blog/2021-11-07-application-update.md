Hi Everyone!\
\
Decisions are out! If you haven't already, please check your emails as soon as possible.

This year we received a large number of applications to Level 2 from extremely qualified candidates. But unfortunately, we had a limited number of spots for our level 2 section and could not accept everyone who applied. So if you applied to Level 2 but received an email saying that you've been accepted to Level 1, it means that we were not able to accept you to Level 2.
