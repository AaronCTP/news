Good Morning, 

CTP would like to thank all of you that attended the first day of Spring Sessions today! We hope you have learned one or two things about the college applications process. But wait! We are not done yet! We will have the second and final day of our Spring Sessions event today starting from 5:00 PM. In today’s session, you will be given the chance to ask questions about college applications and whatnot. Make sure to show up later if you have questions you want to ask the CTP Team or want to hear what the CTP team has to say about the different facets of the college application process during the Q&A. We can’t wait to see y'all there!

P.S. You can find the zoom link for the Spring Sessions event on the poster that has been shared via all of our social media platforms or you can [click here](http://tinyurl.com/ctp2021spring).
