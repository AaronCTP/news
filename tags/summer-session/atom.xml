<h3 id="application-description">Application Description</h3>
<p>Welcome to CTP Ethiopia’s 2021 Summer Sessions Application. As the COVID-19 outbreak develops, we are doing everything we can to hold our regular summer sessions while keeping our CTP students and instructors safe. Hence, in light of the public health advice, and travel restrictions this year’s session will take place virtually. Once accepted, attendance to the summer session is completely <strong>FREE</strong>! Our team is working really hard to make these new virtual sessions as fruitful and worthwhile as our traditional in-person sessions. We have limited space so make sure to complete this application as soon as possible. To be considered for the summer sessions, you have to complete this application in its entirety.</p>
