      <![CDATA[<h2 id="spring-sessions-are-back">Spring Sessions are back!</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce that CTP will be holding its annual Spring Sessions event this weekend over Zoom, and you are all invited! We will discuss everything about the College Application Process. We will talk about the Common Application, Standardized Tests, Financial Aid, Essays, and a whole lot more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is off-limits!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will get to hear about the experiences of students that navigated the college application process and made it to the other side. You will also have the chance to get all of your questions answered during the Q&amp;A. You can find more information about the Spring Sessions event on the poster below. We hope to see you there!</p>
