<h3 id="application-description">Application Description</h3>
<p>Welcome to CTP Ethiopia’s 2021 Summer Sessions Application. As the COVID-19 outbreak develops, we are doing everything we can to hold our regular summer sessions while keeping our CTP students and instructors safe. Hence, in light of the public health advice, and travel restrictions this year’s session will take place virtually. Once accepted, attendance to the summer session is completely <strong>FREE</strong>! Our team is working really hard to make these new virtual sessions as fruitful and worthwhile as our traditional in-person sessions. We have limited space so make sure to complete this application as soon as possible. To be considered for the summer sessions, you have to complete this application in its entirety.</p>

          <p>Hi Everyone!\
Decisions are out! If you haven't already, please check your emails as soon as possible. This year, we received a large number of applications to Level 2 from extremely qualified candidates. But unfortunately, we had a limited number of spots for our level 2 section and could not accept everyone who applied. So if you applied to Level 2 but received an email saying that you've been accepted to Level 1, it means that we were not able to accept you to Level 2.</p>

          <p>Good Morning, </p>
<p>\
CTP would like to thank all of you that attended the first day of Spring Sessions today! We hope you have learned one or two things about the college applications process. But wait! We are not done yet! We will have the second and final day of our Spring Sessions event today starting from 5:00 PM. In today’s session, you will be given the chance to ask questions about college applications and whatnot. Make sure to show up later if you have questions you want to ask the CTP Team or want to hear what the CTP team has to say about the different facets of the college application process during the Q&amp;A. We can’t wait to see y'all there!</p>
<p>P.S. You can find the zoom link for the Spring Sessions event on the poster that has been shared via all of our social media platforms or you can <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ctp2021spring">click here</a>.</p>
